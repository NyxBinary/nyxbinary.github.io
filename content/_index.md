<kbd>HELLO</kbd> + <kbd>THERE</kbd> + <kbd>!</kbd>

My name is Dani (Daniel) Debassige. I'm a computer science graduate from the University of Mantioba, currently still residing in Manitoba.

At the moment I am working at <a href="https://therealescape.ca/">The Real Escape Canada</a>
as a Software Engineer! By working with embedded systems I get to design puzzles and
experiences and bring them to life, there is nothing more gratifying than seeing your creations work well.

I love tinkering, which includes a vast range of things like 3d printing, electronics, and networking.

I also love space! Feel free to nerd out with me anytime. I really enjoy the subject of space infrastructure, and the possibility of megastructures.

> Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the drug store, but that's just peanuts to space.
